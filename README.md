# Tableau Presentations: Marriage and Birth Rates

## Overview

This repository contains Tableau visualizations created by Justin Calka, Gianna Martinez, Bryan Pierre, and Jacob Powell, exploring the trends in marriage and birth rates over the years. The visualizations aim to provide insights into the changes in societal norms, particularly focusing on the decline in marriage rates since 1980 and the consistent total number of births.

## Introduction

The primary goal of these visualizations is to compare marriage and birth rates over the years, shedding light on societal trends. While the data sets do not provide causation, they serve as valuable insights into societal shifts. The visualizations are designed to be easily understandable and to spark interest in understanding the reasons behind these changes.

## Questions

The team aimed to decipher the reasons behind the decline in marriage rates from 1980 to 2019. Although causation wasn't identified, the visualizations highlight significant periods and offer hypotheses, such as changes in societal norms. The analysis also covers the consistency in the total number of births, providing a comprehensive view of demographic trends.

## Methods

The team chose a dataset that included Birth, Marriage, and Death rates from 1960 to 2020. After encoding the data into an Excel file, Tableau was used to create visualizations. Different color schemes were employed to distinguish between rates and total numbers, enhancing clarity. The visualizations encapsulate marriage rates, birth rates, total marriages, and total births.

## Results

The visualizations were designed for simplicity and quick information retrieval. The charts highlight the decline in marriage rates since around 1980, with a significant drop in 2019-2020. The total number of marriages shows a more subtle decline, while birth rates exhibit a decrease, albeit less sharp than marriages. The visualizations prompt discussion on societal changes, with COVID-19 identified as a potential factor in the 2019-2020 decline.

## Discussion

The analysis suggests a nationwide declining trend in marriage rates, particularly since 1980, with a contrasting rise from the 1960s to 1980. Birth rates show a current declining trend, attributed to the impact of COVID-19 in 2019-2020. The visualizations emphasize the importance of not inferring direct connections between birth and marriage rates, highlighting the need for further research.

## Contribution

The team collaborated on tasks during virtual meetings, with Jacob Powell focusing on visualization creation. Each member contributed to different sections based on their expertise and roles from the initial proposal. The collaborative effort ensured a comprehensive exploration of the data and effective storytelling through visualizations.
